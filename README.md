Kniconic
========

A Wordpress child theme based on Iconic One.

Features
--------

The Kniconic theme doesn't add to the standard features offered by the Iconic One theme, but instead makes various stylistic
changes to the original theme. Main changes to the original design include:

* Swapping the original Ubuntu font with Lato.
* An alternate masthead style, while keeping all the original functionality.
* Orange is the primary colour used instead of Blue
* More rounded corners.
* A better looking search box.
* In-built styles for the contact form plugin.
* An alternate style footer.
* Alternate style comment threads.
* Differently styled headers.
* Larger maximum width for use better suited for widescreen monitors.
